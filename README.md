# M1-challenge-accessibility

This HTML and CSS sheet are enhanced for the purpose of meeting accessibility standards. They contain logical flow, semantic elements, comments.

# Description 

The CSS sheet was enhances in 3 different ways. First, selectors and properties in the CSS shet were consolidated to provide better flow and for organizational purposes. Second, the sheet was re-organized to coincide with the organization of the linked HTML. Third, comments were added to the CSS sheet to describe the selectors and the flow. 
The HTML was enhanced in multiple ways. Non-semantic elements were adjusted to semantic elements when applicable. Alt atributes were added to images. A descriptive title was added. The structure of the HTML elements were re-organized to flow in logical order. The heading elements were organized to fall in sequential order. Comments were added to the html elements.
